I’m a Senior Full-Stack Engineer building scalable SaaS and Web3 products for startups and growth-stage companies, with a focus on performance, reliability, and clean system design. I work primarily with React, Rust, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to ship production-ready software used by real users.

I started my career deep in JavaScript, but as systems became more complex, higher throughput, tighter latency, real money on the line, I leaned into Rust to build safer, faster backend services without sacrificing maintainability. That shift now shapes how I think about architecture: predictable systems, explicit trade-offs, and code that fails loudly instead of silently.

Over the past few years, I’ve built and shipped:

-- Full-stack SaaS platforms with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL
-- High-performance backend services and tooling in Rust
-- Web3 integrations including smart contract interactions and on-chain data pipelines
-- AI-powered internal tools that automate workflows and improve developer velocity

Outside day-to-day engineering, I share what I’m learning in public, breaking down system design decisions, Rust mental models, and real lessons from building and scaling products. Many of my posts come directly from problems I’ve solved in production or conversations with founders and engineers building under real constraints.

If you’re building a SaaS, Web3, or AI-driven product and care about strong foundations, not just shipping fast, but shipping right, I’m always open to meaningful conversations.
